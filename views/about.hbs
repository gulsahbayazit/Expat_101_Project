<h1>About us</h1>
  <br>
<p>Our platform was founded by two expats who are also technology enthusiasts based in Germany. They recognized the challenges faced by many expats who move to a new country, and saw an opportunity to use technology to help ease the transition process.
</p>
 <p>
As experienced expats themselves, they know firsthand the struggles of navigating a new culture and building a life in a foreign country. With their combined expertise in technology and international living, they set out to create a platform that would make life easier for expats all around the world.
<p>
Their vision was to create a one-stop-shop for expats, offering a range of resources to help them thrive in their new home country. They wanted to create a community where expats could share their experiences, while also accessing expert advice and guidance from those who have been there before.
    </p>
    <p>
Thanks to their passion and dedication, our platform has become a go-to resource for expats across the globe. We are proud to have been founded by fellow expats who are committed to helping others succeed in their new home countries.

        <p>I am a junior fullstack developer with an architecture/design background and realized that problem solving, design, programming and the digital world are what I love most. To develop a good digital product interface, to work in a multidisciplinary team, it is essential to understand both the perspective of design and development.</p>
